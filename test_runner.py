from django.test.runner import DiscoverRunner

class NoDbTestRunner(DiscoverRunner):
    """
    A Django test runner that bypasses test database creation and destruction.

    This runner allows tests to run against the existing configured
    `DATABASES['default']` without creating a new test database. It is useful
    when working with read-only databases or when the test environment already
    has the required data.

    Note:
        Use with caution â€” running tests against a live database may lead to
        unintended data modifications.

    Overrides:
        - setup_databases: Does nothing and returns an empty list.
        - teardown_databases: Does nothing.

        Skip test database creation.

        Args:
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments (ignored).

        Returns:
            list: An empty list indicating no test databases were set up.
