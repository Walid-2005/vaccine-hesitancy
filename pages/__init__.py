# This file marks the directory as a Python package.
# It allows modules in this folder to be imported as part of the package (e.g., vacapp.wsgi).
# Even if left empty, its presence is required for Python to treat the directory as a package.

# You can also place package-level constants, imports, or metadata here if needed.
